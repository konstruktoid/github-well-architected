Generative AI (GenAI) tools like GitHub Copilot deliver multi-dimensional value across productivity metrics, collaboration effectiveness, and application security posture. This document provides a structured, data-driven measurement framework to quantify ROI and demonstrate business value throughout your implementation journey.

## Phased Impact Model

Organizations should establish a comprehensive measurement strategy that captures value at three distinct phases:

1. **Onboard Metrics**: Assess deployment effectiveness and user access
2. **Adoption Metrics**: Evaluate usage patterns and feature utilization
3. **Success Metrics**: Quantify tangible business outcomes and ROI

## Phase 1: Onboard Metrics

**Key Question: Are users properly provisioned with enterprise-managed GenAI tools?**

Effective implementation requires that users receive appropriate access to GenAI tools governed by enterprise guardrails. Track metrics such as license activation rate and onboarding completion.

For Copilot, [GitHub Enterprise settings](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-copilot-for-your-enterprise/managing-policies-and-features-for-copilot-in-your-enterprise) helps Copilot stay compliant with organizational policies, and the [User Management REST API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/copilot/copilot-user-management?apiVersion=2022-11-28) provides quantitative tracking of license activations.

**Implementation Control Checklist:**

- License entitlement management processes defined
- Infrastructure security protocols assessed
- Information retention & data protection policies reviewed
- Reliability & safety mechanisms reviewed
- OSS compliance requirements satisfied

## Phase 2: Adoption Metrics

**Key Question: Are users actively engaging with the GenAI tool as expected?**

Track feature utilization and engagement patterns through both qualitative and quantitative methods to build a comprehensive view of adoption trends and potential barriers. Using both approaches provides a balanced perspective that captures both subjective experiences and objective usage data.

**Qualitative Measurement:**
We measure by asking for users' direct feedback on GenAI impact on their professional efficiency. This may come in the form of focus sessions, 1:1s, structured questionnaires or polls, and incorporating into existing [developer experience surveys](https://github.com/github/copilot-survey-engine).

**Quantitative Measurement:**
Track feature utilization and engagement patterns to identify adoption trends and potential barriers. For Copilot, the [Metrics REST API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/copilot/copilot-metrics?apiVersion=2022-11-28) provides detailed insights on usage patterns, allowing organizations to monitor and analyze adoption pattern:

- Code suggestion and acceptance rate
- IDE-specific usage
- Utilization of different LLM models
- Knowledge discovery, acquisition, and generation through interactive events (chat, copy, acceptance, etc)
- Usage trends over time to determine if adoption is accelerating or plateauing

Segment adoption metrics by organization and teams to identify areas requiring additional support or training.

## Phase 3: Success Metrics

**Key Question: How is the GenAI tool enabling organizations to create measurable business value?**

As users integrate GenAI features into their workflows, measure tangible business outcomes with a balanced framework. This validates the organization-specific success criteria of the GenAI tooling investment.

GitHub has a point-of-view detailed in the [four engineering system success zones](../productivity/recommendations/engineering-system-metrics).

**Measurement Approach:** Track where teams are positioned on the [J-curve of change](https://www.david-viney.me/post/the-j-curve-of-change), focusing on identifying the inflection point where productivity gains materialize.

## Common Impact Scenarios

Common business challenges where Copilot may assist:

1. **Quality Enhancement** - test coverage & reliability, bug defect reduction, code quality & maintainability

2. **Developer Productivity** - task completion time, code review quality, onboarding time

3. **Security Posture** - vulnerability detection & resolution, secure coding adoption, dependency upgrade

4. **Innovation Acceleration** - feature development time, prototype speed
