## TL;DR How we work together

- :octocat: See [GitHub Well-Architected Framework overview] to understand the program and purpose.
- 🗳️ We use [GitHub Flow] to manage changes. It is the most effective way to collaborate with all stakeholders on this project.
- 🐙 [Issues] are used to **track work**, such as bug reports and feature requests. They are also used to keep track of ideas that may not yet be ready to work on.
- 🚢 [Pull requests] are the best way to collaborate on reviews.

### Step 1: Create GitHub Issue

Start by creating an issue to propose your article idea. This helps us:

- Track contributions and avoid duplicate work
- Provide early feedback on your proposal
- Connect you with subject matter experts
- Ensure alignment with the framework's pillars

[Create a content request Issue] using our template, which will guide you through:

- Selecting the relevant pillar(s)
- Describing your proposed article
- Outlining the value it provides

> [!TIP]
> Browse existing [Issues] to see if someone else is already working on a similar topic. Collaboration is encouraged!

---

### Step 2: Fork & Author

Once you're ready to start, fork the repository and begin authoring. We **strongly recommend using GitHub Codespaces, a preconfigured IDE** for the best experience.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before creating a Codespace, verify your billing details. See [Codespaces pricing information].

#### Launch project in Codespaces

##### Option 1: Select

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/github/github-well-architected-internal)

##### Option 2: From your fork

1. Click the green "Code" button and select "Create codespace on main"
2. Wait for the environment to initialize (automatically runs `tools/setup` to install dependencies and build the site)
3. Start writing!

##### Option 3: From the repository

1. Go to <https://github.com/codespaces>, click "New Codespace", select this repository, and choose the `main` branch
2. Select the default Dev container configuration: **Default project configuration**
3. Click "Create Codespace"

#### Create your article

There are three options to create a new article:

##### Option 1. Use the command `hugo new content` to create a new file (recommended in Codespaces)

```shell
# For recommendations:
hugo new content library/{PILLAR}/recommendations/{ARTICLE-NAME}.md
# For scenarios:
hugo new content library/scenarios/{ARTICLE-NAME}.md
```

For example,

```shell
hugo new content library/productivity/recommendations/my-article.md
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you use this method, you do not need to put `content/` in the command since Hugo considers it the root.

##### Option 2. Use a page bundle to create a new article with associated files like images

Add a folder (instead of one markdown file) at that location and bundle the files together. The format is:

```plaintext
content/library/{PILLAR}/recommendations/{ARTICLE-NAME}/index.md
content/library/{PILLAR}/recommendations/{ARTICLE-NAME}/image1.png
content/library/{PILLAR}/recommendations/{ARTICLE-NAME}/image2.png
```

##### Option 3. Copy/paste the template into a new file

Simply copy [`archetypes/default.md`] and paste it into:

For **recommendation** articles:

```plaintext
content/library/{PILLAR}/recommendations/{ARTICLE-NAME}.md
```

For **scenario** articles:

```plaintext
content/library/scenarios/{ARTICLE-NAME}.md
```

##### Writing Style:

- Always use sentence case
- Keep your files tidy - no rogue spaces or characters, please
- Use dashes for unordered lists (not `*`)
- Use single spaces before and after headings, lists, and paragraphs

#### Edit front-matter

Each article (written in markdown) should have front-matter at the top of the file. This front-matter should look like this:

```yaml
---
draft: true # Set to false when ready to publish
title: 'Insert title here'
publishDate: 2024-12-05 # Date the article is published

# Add author details
params:
  authors:
    [
      { name: 'Mona', handle: 'octocat' },
    ]

# Classifications of the framework to drive key concepts, design principles, and architectural best practices
pillars:
  - placeholder
  - placeholder
---
```

- When you are done with your article, set `draft: false` when you are ready to publish.

- Set `publishDate` to the date the article is first merged to `main`. Do not change it on future revisions.

- All recommended values for all of these fields are described in [Taxonomies]. **Insert all that apply to your article. This is how your article will be discoverable!**

---

### Step 3: Build & Test - Verify your changes

Before submitting your pull request, test your article in the IDE to ensure everything looks correct.

#### Run test & lint

Run predefined tools in your Codespace terminal. To test,

```bash
tools/test
```

To lint markdown and YAML files,

```bash
tools/lint
```

#### Run the development server

In your Codespace terminal, run:

```bash
tools/server
```

The Codespace will automatically forward the port and display the URL where you can view the site. If you can't find it:

1. Click on the **Ports** tab in VS Code
2. Look for the forwarded address for port 1313
3. Click the globe icon to open it in your browser

![Codespace Forwarded Address](../static/media/codespace-forwarded-address.png)

The server watches for changes and automatically reloads as you edit files.

#### What to check

- [ ] Does your article render correctly?
- [ ] Are images and links working?
- [ ] Is the formatting clean and consistent?
- [ ] Does navigation work as expected?
- [ ] Run the test suite: `tools/test`

> [!TIP]
> Commit your changes frequently as you work. This helps you track progress and makes it easier to recover if something goes wrong.

---

### Step 4: Raise Pull Request

Once you're satisfied with your article, it's time to initiate review.

#### Create your pull request

1. Commit all your changes to your fork
2. Push your changes to your fork on GitHub
3. Open a pull request from your fork to the main repository
4. Fill out the PR template with:
   - A clear description of your article
   - Link to the related issue
   - Any special considerations for reviewers

> [!TIP]
> Give your PR a descriptive title that summarizes your contribution, such as "Add productivity article on GitHub Actions caching strategies"

---

### Step 5: Automated QA - Quality validation

Once you submit your PR, automated checks will run:

- **Build verification**: Ensures the site builds successfully
- **Linting**: Checks markdown formatting and style
- **Link validation**: Verifies all URLs are accessible
- **Test suite**: Runs automated tests

You'll see the status of these checks in your PR. If any fail, review the logs and make necessary corrections.

---

### Step 6: Community Review - Collaborate and refine

Your PR will be reviewed by maintainers and community members. This collaborative process helps ensure quality and alignment with the framework.

**What to expect:**

- Constructive feedback on content, structure, and technical accuracy
- Suggestions for improvements or clarifications
- Questions about your recommendations and their rationale

**How to respond:**

- Address feedback by making additional commits to your PR branch
- Engage in discussions - ask questions if something isn't clear
- Mark conversations as resolved once addressed
- Be open to iteration - great content often requires refinement

> [!TIP]
> Reviewers are here to help make your contribution the best it can be. Don't hesitate to ask for clarification or discuss alternative approaches!

---

### Step 7: GitHub Review - Maintainer approval

Once your PR is approved by the community, GitHub maintainers will perform a final review:

- **Quality check**: Maintainers verify the content meets framework standards
- **Technical accuracy**: Final validation of recommendations and examples
- **Approval**: Maintainers approve the PR for publishing

You'll be notified when maintainers begin their review and if any final adjustments are needed.

> [!NOTE]
> This is the final checkpoint before your contribution goes live!

---

### Step 8: Publish - Go live!

Once approved, your article automatically publishes to the live site at [wellarchitected.github.com](https://wellarchitected.github.com).

**What happens:**

- The site rebuilds and deploys with your new content
- Your article is live and accessible to the community
- Your PR merges to the main branch

## Types of contributions

There are several primary types of contributions to this project:

- [📝 Content Library Article Submission(s)]: This involves adding or editing Content Library articles (and other forms of content that are not code)
- [💻 Website Code Changes]: This includes bug fixes, feature enhancements, and other code-related contributions for the site such as testing
- [🏠 General housekeeping contributions]: This section provides guidance for general housekeeping, like updating our README or related docs

### 📝 Content Library Article Submission(s)

Contributions will typically author content articles under `/content/` folder. To start writing, we recommend reviewing these essential framework resources:

- [Framework Overview] - Learn about the WAF mission, vision, objectives, and five pillars
- [Taxonomies](/docs/taxonomies.md) - Explore the design principles, areas, and other classifications

**Inspiration for Content Library articles** comes from **Azure Architecture Center**. See the following example articles for your inspiration: 💡

- [📄 Reliability: Recommendations for designing for redundancy][reliability-redundancy]
- [📄 Security: Recommendations for identity and access management][security-identity-access]
- [📄 Cost Optimization: Recommendations for optimizing environment costs][cost-optimize-environment]
- [📄 Operational Excellence: Recommendations for using infrastructure as code][operational-iac]
- [📄 Performance Efficiency: Recommendations for capacity planning][performance-capacity-planning]

### 💻 Website Code Changes

Contributing code changes to the website includes bug fixes, feature enhancements, and other code-related contributions.

When contributing code, please follow these guidelines:

- **Create a new branch**: Always create a new branch for your changes. This keeps the default branch clean and ready for deployment.
- **Follow our coding standards**: Ensure your code adheres to the project's coding standards. This includes proper indentation, commenting, and naming conventions.
- **Write tests**: If your code introduces new functionality, make sure to include corresponding tests. This helps ensure that the functionality works as expected and prevents future changes from breaking your code.
- **Pass all tests**: Before submitting your pull request, make sure all tests pass. This includes both tests you've added and existing tests.
- **Update documentation**: If your changes require updates to the documentation, include those updates in your pull request.

### 🏠 General housekeeping contributions

Other guidance for general housekeeping, like updating our README or related docs.

When proposing housekeeping updates, please keep the following in mind:

- **Clarity and simplicity**: Documentation should be easy to understand. Avoid jargon, keep sentences short and clear, and use examples where possible.
- **Accuracy**: Make sure your updates are accurate. This includes both the content of the update and any code snippets or commands included in the documentation.
- **Consistency**: Try to keep the style and tone of the documentation consistent. If you're unsure about the style, look at existing documentation for guidance.
- **Proofread**: Before submitting your changes, proofread for spelling, grammar, and punctuation errors.

---

## Contributor expectations

To maintain quality and consistency across the framework, we ask that all contributors:

### Quality standards

- **Original content**: Contributions should be your original work or properly attributed
- **Accurate information**: Ensure technical accuracy and verify all claims
- **Opinionated guidance**: Provide prescriptive recommendations, not just descriptions
- **Field-tested practices**: Base recommendations on real-world experience when possible

### Content alignment

Your article should align with the [GitHub Well-Architected Framework's five pillars]:

- **Productivity**: Accelerate development workflows and efficiency
- **Collaboration**: Enhance teamwork within and across teams
- **Application Security**: Secure applications with GitHub's security features
- **Governance**: Manage compliance, controls, and oversight
- **Architecture**: Design scalable, reliable GitHub deployments

See [Framework Overview] for details on each pillar.

### Style requirements

- Use **sentence case** for all headings and titles
- Write in **simple Markdown** - keep it tidy
- Use **dashes (`-`)** for unordered lists, not asterisks
- Keep sentences **short and clear**
- Avoid unnecessary jargon
- Include practical examples
- Prefer GitHub Docs links to **Enterprise Cloud**: `https://docs.github.com/enterprise-cloud@latest` (unless the guidance is specific to GitHub Enterprise Server)
- Use Hugo shortcodes to keep articles consistent (see `archetypes/default.md`):
  - Further assistance: `{{% seeking-further-assistance-details %}}`
  - Related links: `{{% related-links-github-docs %}}`

### Callouts

Use Hextra callouts to highlight important information:

```md
{{< callout type="info" >}}
This is an informational note.
{{< /callout >}}
```

Use `type` for standard callouts (`info`, `warning`, `error`). For custom callouts, use `emoji`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Remember: [GitHub Docs] is the primary source of truth. Our framework supplements documentation with design thinking and decision-making guidance.
